# Todo-API
Spring boot based REST API developed using Test Driven Development for todo management

Chaos Monkey , a product based company based out of Santa Clara, California has reached out to you to build a backend server for a TODO application.

They are in a multi vendor setup where they frontend is being developed by Company X . The frontend developers at Company X will be consuming the  APIs you will be building .

There are basically 4 operations the user of the app could do 
1. Get the TODO data from the DB
2. Create a new TODO
3. Update an existing TODO
4. Delete a TODO

You could come up with the DB Design to store the data for every TODO. The database choice is upto you.  Use Flyway migrations to create your tables.

The clients expect code to be developed the TDD way, clean and with rich commit messages. Once the development is complete from your side , their developers will maintain the code , so make sure the code you write is maintainable and very readable. Both Integration and Unit tests have to be written.

Database : Postgresql
